> tdlr: A responsive webpage that informs users about what is blockchain technology

## :rocket: Introduction

I wanted to learn how to create websites and learn the nooks and crannies of HTML and CSS, which prompted me to work on a website. I chose to create a website on the topic of blockchain, targetting beginners.

Blockchain technology is slowly gaining its popularity. My website is for people that do not know much about the field
and therefore I wanted to keep the content short and concise. I tried to keep my website as simple as possible, making sure people are able to navigate through the whole site with ease.
