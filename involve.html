			<h2>Acquire Bitcoins</h2>

						<h3>Accepting bitcoin payments:</h3>
						<p> The easiest way to get into bitcoin as an entrepreneur is to start <mark>accepting bitcoin payments through a merchant solution</mark>. In 2015, there were more than 100,000 retailers that had already started to accept bitcoin payments through bitcoin payment processors such as Coinbase, BitPay and Coinify. These retailers now include high-profile businesses like Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md">
						<h3>Purchasing bitcoins:</h3>
						<p> You can purchase bitcoins using cash through a <mark>bitcoin exchange</mark> and then transfer the bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet. A <mark>bitcoin wallet</mark> is used to store your private keys which are matched to your bitcoin address as evidence of your ownership of the bitcoin. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md">
						<h3>Mining bitcoins:</h3>
						<p> Mining bitcoins is like mining for gold, except that instead of mining in a physical geographic location, you mine bitcoins on the <mark>online bitcoin network</mark>. Your tools for bitcoin mining are not gold pans and buckets but a <mark>powerful computer and specialized software</mark>. You mine bitcoins by <mark>solving complex math puzzles</mark>. As of July 2016, miners compete for a reward of 25 bitcoins approximately every 10 minutes when they successfully solve a puzzle. The supply of new bitcoins will continue to drop by half every four years. </p>
						<p> When bitcoin mining was still new, you could mine using an off-the-shelf computer. Now that there are a lot more people competing to mine, you need to spend more money for faster hardware. A cheaper alternative is to combine your computer power with other groups of bitcoin miners through <mark>mining pools</mark> like Slush’s Pool. Bitcoins mined are divided among the group in line with what has been contributed to the pool. </p>

			<h2>Engaging in services for bitcoin</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md">
						<h3>Digital or hardware wallet service:</h3>
						<p> All owners of bitcoins need a secure place to store their bitcoins. At the moment, they store them in a <mark>digital or hardware wallet</mark> that is similar to a virtual bank account. The biggest threat to digital wallets are hackers. Hackers have been known to break into digital wallets. These bitcoins are not backed by any government or the Federal Reserve. Once stolen, owners have no way of getting back their bitcoins or have much recourse against the hackers. Online security for digital wallets will probably be extremely important for bitcoin’s future. </p>
						<p> To protect your bitcoins, you can use <mark>cold wallets.</mark> These are hardware wallets that aren’t connected to the internet, which keeps them away from hackers. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md">
						<div class="row">
							<h3>Bitcoin payment processors:</h3>
							<p> Also known as <mark>bitcoin exchanges</mark>, there are multiple bitcoin payment processors that have received substantial funding from venture capitalists to create services to process payments on behalf of vendors. Large businesses like Amazon, Microsoft and Dell all use these services. </p>

			<h2>Provide solution for bitcoin acceptance</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm">
						<p> One of the biggest challenges that bitcoin faces for its survival is to find acceptance among non-users. Current bitcoin owners are invested in the success of bitcoin’s future. If you can create a way to <mark>make bitcoin more widely understood and accepted</mark> by the public, you are onto a winner. </p>
					</div>

			<h2>Leverage blockchain technology</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm">
						<p> Blockchain is the technology that makes bitcoin digital currency possible. It is a public digital ledger of all executed bitcoin transactions.</p>
						<p> For many financial institutions, the blockchain recording system holds promise as a <mark>secure, improved and transparent method to speed up transactions, cut costs and eliminate fraud</mark>. Because of this, some organizations, including financial institutions, are looking for ways to leverage blockchain technology for their own businesses. </p>
						<p> This represents a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to find new ways to leverage blockchain technology in order to create better systems and services for these organizations. </p>
